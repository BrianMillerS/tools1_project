## PROJECT OVERVIEW  
The main goal of this analysis is to attempt to identify the best performing NBA 5-player lineup.  
- Lineup performance was quanified using the following metric for each entire season: (# points scored - # points allowed)/ # posessions.  
- Average lineup salary, average lineupe age, and home court advantage were the three variables significantly associated with lineup performance (glm, p<0.05)
- All player stats and play-by-play data was obtained from [www.basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).  
- For convience, play-by-play data was used from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schmadam97/nba-playbyplay-data-20182019?resource=download)
- For the purposes of this analysis we only focused on the 2016 NBA season.
